184	SUBSTRATE	*	These results suggest that PDE4B mediates the antipsychotic effects of rolipram in CAR and that the << PDE4B >>-regulated [[ cyclic adenosine monophosphate ]] signaling pathway may play a role in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychosis.

189	UPREGULATOR	*	On the basis of data obtained in rabbits, the imidazoline receptor ligand << rilmenidine >> has been suggested to decrease blood pressure in humans by activating central [[ alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors ]].
190	ACTIVATOR	*	A prerequisite for this hypothesis was the unproved assumption that rabbit and human << alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors >> are equally activated by [[ rilmenidine ]].
191	INHIBITOR	*	Human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary arteries were used to determine the potencies of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists in inhibiting the electrically (2 Hz) evoked [(3)H]norepinephrine release and of antagonists in counteracting the << alpha(2)-adrenoceptor >>-mediated inhibition induced by [[ moxonidine ]].
192	ANTAGONIST	*	In the rabbit pulmonary artery, << rilmenidine >> and oxymetazoline are potent full agonists, whereas in the human atrial appendages they are antagonists at the [[ alpha(2)-autoreceptors ]], sharing this property with rauwolscine, phentolamine, and idazoxan.

197	AGONIST	*	The sympathetic nerves of both the human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary artery are endowed with << alpha(2A)-autoreceptors >>, at which, however, both rilmenidine and [[ oxymetazoline ]] exhibit different properties (antagonism and agonism, respectively).

199	ANTAGONIST	*	The antagonistic property of << rilmenidine >> at [[ human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors ]] indicates that in contrast to the suggestion based on rabbit data, the hypotensive property of the drug in humans is not due to activation of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors but other, presumably I(1)-imidazoline receptors, are probably involved.
