973	SUBSTRATE	*	We have expressed VIAAT and the << plasmalemmal transporters >> for [[ glycine ]] and GABA in a neuroendocrine cell line and measured the quantal release of glycine and GABA using a novel double-sniffer patch-clamp technique.
974	SUBSTRATE	*	We found that << glycine >> is released from vesicles when [[ VIAAT ]] is coexpressed with either the neuronal transporter GlyT2 or the glial transporter GlyT1.
975	SUBSTRATE	*	However, GlyT2 was more effective than GlyT1, probably because GlyT2 is unable to operate in the reverse mode, which gives it an advantage in maintaining the high cytosolic << glycine >> concentration required for efficient vesicular loading by [[ VIAAT ]].
976	SUBSTRATE	*	The vesicular inhibitory phenotype was gradually altered from glycinergic to GABAergic through mixed events when << GABA >> is introduced into the secretory cell and competes for uptake by [[ VIAAT ]].
977	SUBSTRATE	*	Interestingly, the VIAAT ortholog from Caenorhabditis elegans (UNC-47), a species lacking glycine transmission, also supports << glycine >> exocytosis in the presence of [[ GlyT2 ]], and a point mutation of UNC-47 that abolishes GABA transmission in the worm confers glycine specificity.
978	SUBSTRATE	*	Together, these results suggest that an increased cytosolic availability of << glycine >> in [[ VIAAT ]]-containing terminals was crucial for the emergence of glycinergic transmission in vertebrates.

2419	ANTAGONIST	*	The tacrine pressor response was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the i.c.v. administration of the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (ID50 = 1.45 microg), the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (ID50 = 4.33 microg), the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine (ID50 = 1.39 microg) and the << muscarinic M3 receptor >> antagonist [[ para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol ]] (ID50 = 31.19 microg).
2420	INHIBITOR	*	State-dependent << cocaine >> block of [[ sodium channel ]] isoforms, chimeras, and channels coexpressed with the beta1 subunit.
2421	INHIBITOR	*	<< Cocaine >> block of [[ human cardiac (hH1) ]] and rat skeletal (mu1) muscle sodium channels was examined under whole-cell voltage clamp in transiently transfected HEK293t cells.
2422	INHIBITOR	*	<< Cocaine >> block of human cardiac (hH1) and [[ rat skeletal (mu1) muscle sodium channels ]] was examined under whole-cell voltage clamp in transiently transfected HEK293t cells.
2423	INHIBITOR	*	<< Cocaine >> block of [[ hH1 channels ]] was greater than block of mu1 channels at voltages between -120 mV and -90 mV, suggesting that greater steady-state inactivation of hH1 channels in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to cocaine block.
2424	INHIBITOR	*	<< Cocaine >> block of hH1 channels was greater than block of [[ mu1 channels ]] at voltages between -120 mV and -90 mV, suggesting that greater steady-state inactivation of hH1 channels in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to cocaine block.
2425	INHIBITOR	*	<< Cocaine >> block of hH1 channels was greater than block of mu1 channels at voltages between -120 mV and -90 mV, suggesting that greater steady-state inactivation of [[ hH1 channels ]] in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to cocaine block.
2426	INHIBITOR	*	Cocaine block of hH1 channels was greater than block of mu1 channels at voltages between -120 mV and -90 mV, suggesting that greater steady-state inactivation of << hH1 channels >> in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to [[ cocaine ]] block.
